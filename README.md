1. Run init_crawling_artist_info.py to get information about artists from www.last.fm
2. After that run init_crawling_albums.py to get information about albums of found artists.
3. Finally, run init_crawling_songs.py to get list of songs of found artists.
4. To find texts of songs run Genius_api.py and wait :)
